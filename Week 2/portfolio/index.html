        <p>Hello, my name is Ryan Jablonski. I am a junior Information Systems student at Grand Valley State University.</p>
        <p>Within the IS major, I've decided to focus on Software Development as it is my goal to make a career out of Software Development.</p>
        <p>During my free time, I participate in a life group through Campus Ministry and spend lots of time with friends.</p>
        <p>Thank you for checking out my portfolio! If you'd like to reach out, please go to the "Contact" page and contact me through any of the listed options.</p>
