            <p class="lead">Hello, my name is Ryan Jablonski. I am a student at Grand Valley State University. I am majoring in Information Systems (with a focus on software development) and minoring in Business.</p>
            <p class="lead">Throughtout my time in college I have taken various computing courses where I've learned programming languages like Java and Python. I've also gained computing experience as a Systems Analyst intern at Koops Automation Systems where I used C# and platforms like Azure and Jira.</p>

                Why Information Systems?

                <p>For as long as I can remember, I've always loved technology. Whether I was using our home computer, video game consoles, or the iPad's in my 3rd grade classroom, I always knew that I wanted to do something with technology when I grew up. The Information Systems program at GVSU gves me the opportunity to do that.</p>
                <p>My interest in technology wasn't the only factor that swayed me towards majoring in Information Systems. I want to spend my professional life building computing solutions for our worlds biggest problems. To me, a fulfilling and successful career is one that is spent helping people. Computing technologies have already allowed us to do so much and I want to be a small part of the community that pushes the bounds of what we know.</p>

              <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>For spring break this year, I went on a Campus Ministry mission trip to Nicaragua. While we were there, we lived with local families to learn about their culture and then headed to a childrens camp to destroy an old cabin and build new chairs.</p>
                <p>My second highlight is that this semester was socially eventfull. I met a ton of new people and spent a lot of time with friends new and old.</p>
                <p>Finally, I really enjoyed my website class. Web development is a topic that's always interested me so it was a lot of fun getting the chance to learn and use the technologies associated with web development.</p>
