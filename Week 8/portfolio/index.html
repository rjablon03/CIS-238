            <p>Hello, my name is Ryan Jablonski. I am a student at Grand Valley State University. I am majoring in Information Systems (with a focus on software development) and minoring in Business.</p>
            <p>Throughtout my time in college I have taken various computing courses where I've learned programming languages like Java and Python. I've also gained computing experience as a Systems Analyst intern at Koops Automation Systems where I used C# and platforms like Azure and Jira.</p>
            <p>During my free time, I participate in a life group through Campus Ministry, play various games like pool and ping-pong, and spend lots of time with friends.</p>

            <h2>Why Information Systems?</h2>
            <p>For as long as I can remember, I've always loved technology. Whether I was using our home computer, video game consoles, or the iPad's in my 3rd grade classroom, I always knew that I wanted to do something with technology when I grew up. The Information Systems program at GVSU gves me the opportunity to do that.</p>
            <p>My interest in technology wasn't the only factor that swayed me towards majoring in Information Systems. I want to spend my professional life building computing solutions for our worlds biggest problems. To me, a fulfilling and successful career is one that is spent helping people. Computing technologies have already allowed us to do so much and I want to be a small part of the community that pushes the bounds of what we know.</p>
