                    <p>I spent 8th grade and all of High School at Holland High. I graduated in 2021 with a 3.7 GPA.</p>
                    <p>While attending Holland High, I played the Tenor Saxophone in the Marching Band, Jazz Band, Concert Band, and Wind Ensemble.</p>
                    <p class="tablet-desktop">Some of my favorite classes were AP Governemnt, AP Psychology, Computer Aided Design, and Physics.</p>

                    <p>After graduating high shcool, I decided to attend Michigan Tech for college. I love the Upper Peninsula and had a ton of fun (despite the harsh winter).</p>
                    <p class="tablet-desktop">I played for my halls broomball team and participated in a dodgeball faceoff against another hall. I also conducted my own plant growth experiment in my botany class and trekked through the woods to see the northern lights.</p>
                    <p>However, despite the positive experience, I decided to transfer the GVSU. I loved Michigan Tech but it was just too far away from friends and family. I can confidently say that transferring was a really good decision and I'm really loving Grand Valley.</p>

                    <p>Currently, I am a Junior at Grand Valley State University. Trasferring was a really good decision as I have met a ton of great people, developed existing friendships, and made a ton of memories.</p>
                    <p>All of the professors here have been great and I looking forward to the time that I have left at GV. Some of my favorite classes have been Computer Science 2, Problem Solving Using Spreadsheets, and Professional Responsibilities and Practices.</p>
